# Game Loop

## Start

To start off you need to install LÖVE on your system and then figure out how to run LÖVE projects. The LÖVE version we'll be using is 0.10.2 and it can be downloaded [here](https://love2d.org/). If you're in the future and a new version of LÖVE has been released you can get 0.10.2 [here](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/). You can follow the steps from [this page](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) for further details. Once that's done you should create a `main.lua` file in your project folder with the following contents:

```lua
function love.load()

end

function love.update(dt)

end

function love.draw()

end
```

If you run this you should see a window popup and it should show a black screen. In the code above, once your LÖVE project is run the `love.load` function is run once at the start of the program and `love.update` and `love.draw` are run every frame. So, for instance, if you wanted to load an image and draw it, you'd do something like this:

```lua
function love.load()
    image = love.graphics.newImage('image.png')
end

function love.update(dt)

end

function love.draw()
    love.graphics.draw(image, 0, 0)
end
```

[`love.graphics.newImage`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.newImage) loads the image texture to the `image` variable and then every frame it's drawn at position 0, 0. To see that `love.draw` actually draws the image on every frame, try this:

```lua
love.graphics.draw(image, love.math.random(0, 800), love.math.random(0, 600))
```

The default size of the window is `800x600`, so what this should do is randomly draw the image around the screen really fast:

![](media/bytepath-1_01.gif)

Note that between every frame the screen is cleared, otherwise the image you're drawing randomly would slowly fill the entire screen as it is drawn in random positions. This happens because LÖVE provides a default game loop for its projects that clears the screen at the end of every frame. I'll go over this game loop and how you can change it now.

## Game Loop

The default game loop LÖVE uses can be found in the [`love.run`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.run) page, and it looks like this:

```lua
function love.run()
    if love.math then
    love.math.setRandomSeed(os.time())
    end

    if love.load then love.load(arg) end

    -- We don't want the first frame's dt to include time taken by love.load.
    if love.timer then love.timer.step() end

    local dt = 0

    -- Main loop time.
    while true do
        -- Process events.
        if love.event then
    love.event.pump()
    for name, a,b,c,d,e,f in love.event.poll() do
        if name == "quit" then
    if not love.quit or not love.quit() then
        return a
    end
        end
    love.handlers[name](a,b,c,d,e,f)
    end
    end

    -- Update dt, as we'll be passing it to update
    if love.timer then
        love.timer.step()
        dt = love.timer.getDelta()
    end

    -- Call update and draw
    if love.update then love.update(dt) end -- will pass 0 if love.timer is disabled

    if love.graphics and love.graphics.isActive() then
        love.graphics.clear(love.graphics.getBackgroundColor())
        love.graphics.origin()
                if love.draw then love.draw() end
        love.graphics.present()
    end

    if love.timer then love.timer.sleep(0.001) end
    end
end
```

When the program starts `love.run` is run and then from there everything happens. The function is fairly well commented and you can find out what each function does on the LÖVE wiki. But I'll go over the basics:

```lua
if love.math then
    love.math.setRandomSeed(os.time())
end
```

In the first line we're checking to see if `love.math` is not nil. In Lua all values are true, except for false and nil, so the `if love.math` condition will be true if `love.math` is defined as anything at all. In the case of LÖVE these variables are set to be enabled or not in the [`conf.lua`](https://love2d.org/wiki/Config_Files) file. You don't need to worry about this file for now, but I'm just mentioning it because it's in that file that you can enable or disable individual systems like `love.math`, and so that's why there's a check to see if it's enabled or not before anything is done with one of its functions.

In general, if a variable is not defined in Lua and you refer to it in any way, it will return a nil value. So if you ask `if random_variable` then this will be false unless you defined it before, like `random_variable = 1`.

In any case, if the `love.math` module is enabled (which it is by default) then its seed is set based on the current time. See [`love.math.setRandomSeed`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.math.setRandomSeed) and [`os.time`](https://www.lua.org/pil/22.1.html). After doing this, the `love.load` function is called:

```lua
if love.load then love.load(arg) end
```

`arg` are the command line arguments passed to the LÖVE executable when it runs the project. And as you can see, the reason why [`love.load`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.load) only runs once is because it's only called once, while the update and draw functions are called multiple times inside a loop (and each iteration of that loop corresponds to a frame).

```lua
-- We don't want the first frame's dt to include time taken by love.load.
if love.timer then love.timer.step() end

local dt = 0
```

After calling `love.load` and after that function does all its work, we verify that `love.timer` is defined and call [`love.timer.step`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.timer.step), which measures the time taken between the two last frames. As the comment explains, `love.load` might take a long time to process (because it might load all sorts of things like images and sounds) and that time shouldn't be the first thing returned by `love.timer.getDelta` on the first frame of the game.

`dt` is also initialized to 0 here. Variables in Lua are global by default, so by saying `local dt` it's being defined only to the local scope of the current block, which in this case is the `love.run` function. See more on blocks [here](https://www.lua.org/pil/4.2.html).

```lua
-- Main loop time.
while true do
    -- Process events.
    if love.event then
        love.event.pump()
        for name, a,b,c,d,e,f in love.event.poll() do
            if name == "quit" then
                if not love.quit or not love.quit() then
                    return a
                end
            end
            love.handlers[name](a,b,c,d,e,f)
        end
    end
end
```

This is where the main loop starts. The first thing that is done on each frame is the processing of events. [`love.event.pump`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.event.pump) pushes events to the event queue and according to its description those events are generated by the user in some way, so think key presses, mouse clicks, window resizes, window focus lost/gained and stuff like that. The loop using [`love.event.poll`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.event.poll) goes over the event queue and handles each event. `love.handlers` is a table of functions that calls the relevant callbacks. So, for instance, `love.handlers.quit` will call the `love.quit` function if it exists.

One of the things about LÖVE is that you can define callbacks in the `main.lua` file that will get called when an event happens. A full list of all callbacks is available [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/love). I'll go over callbacks in more detail later, but this is how all that happens. The `a, b, c, d, e, f` arguments you can see passed to `love.handlers[name]` are all the possible arguments that can be used by the relevant functions. For instance, [`love.keypressed`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.keypressed) receives as arguments the key pressed, its scancode and if the key press event is a repeat. So in the case of `love.keypressed` the `a, b, c` values would be defined as something while `d, e, f` would be nil.

```lua
-- Update dt, as we'll be passing it to update
if love.timer then
    love.timer.step()
    dt = love.timer.getDelta()
end

-- Call update and draw
if love.update then love.update(dt) end -- will pass 0 if love.timer is disabled
```

[`love.timer.step`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.timer.step) measures the time between the two last frames and changes the value returned by [`love.timer.getDelta`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.timer.getDelta). So in this case `dt` will contain the time taken for the last frame to run. This is useful because then this value is passed to the `love.update` function, and from there it can be used in the game to define things with constant speeds, despite frame rate changes.

```lua
if love.graphics and love.graphics.isActive() then
    love.graphics.clear(love.graphics.getBackgroundColor())
    love.graphics.origin()
    if love.draw then love.draw() end
    love.graphics.present()
end
```

After calling `love.update`, `love.draw` is called. But before that we verify that the `love.graphics` module exists and that we can draw to the screen via [`love.graphics.isActive`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.isActive). The screen is cleared to the defined background color (initially black) via [`love.graphics.clear`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.clear), transformations are reset via [`love.graphics.origin`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.origin), `love.draw` is finally called and then [`love.graphics.present`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.present) is used to push everything drawn in `love.draw` to the screen. And then finally:

```lua
if love.timer then love.timer.sleep(0.001) end
```

I never understood why [`love.timer.sleep`](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.timer.sleep) needs to be here at the end of the frame, but the [explanation given by a LÖVE developer here](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=76998&p=198629&hilit=love.timer.sleep#p160881) seems reasonable enough.

And with that the `love.run` function ends. Everything that happens inside the `while true` loop is referred to as a frame, which means that `love.update` and `love.draw` are called once per frame. The entire game is basically repeating the contents of that loop really fast (like at 60 frames per second), so get used to that idea. I remember when I was starting it took me a while to get an instinctive handle on how this worked for some reason.

There's a helpful discussion on this function on the [LÖVE forums](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=83578) if you want to read more about it.

Anyway, if you don't want to you don't need to understand all of this at the start, but it's helpful to be somewhat comfortable with editing how your game loop works and to figure out how you want it to work exactly. There's an excellent article that goes over different game loop techniques and does a good job of explaining each. You can find it [here](http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/).
